# Particle Filter Project
## Team: Kiana Hobbs, Elizabeth Singer
## Implementation
### Initialize Particle Cloud
How you will initialize your particle cloud (initialize_particle_cloud()):
</br>

### Particle Positions Update
How you will update the position of the particles will be updated based on the movements of the robot (update_particles_with_motion_model()):
</br>

### Importance Weights
How you will compute the importance weights of each particle after receiving the robot's laser scan data (update_particle_weights_with_measurement_model()):
</br>

### Normalization and Resampling
How you will normalize the particles' importance weights (normalize_particles()) and resample the particles (resample_particles()):
</br>

### Pose Estimation
How you will update the estimated pose of the robot (update_estimated_robot_pose()):

### Noise
How you will incorporate noise into your particle filter.
